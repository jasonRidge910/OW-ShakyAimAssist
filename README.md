# Shaky Hand Aim Assist
Based on: https://github.com/Jire/Overwatcheat (thanks dude, great code)

## WORK IN PROGRESS
This is a work in progress and not ready for use yet. Some instructions might not line up with the actual code.

**Beginner's Guide**

1. Download and install Java OpenJDK 8 or higher from https://jdk.java.net/8/

1. Build the code by running the _build.bat_ script.

1. Binaries are located with the _build_ directory under "OW-ShakyAimAssist"

1. Run the game with the video settings as "Fullscreen Window". The utility will not work others.

1. Once the game is running, start the utility by opening a command prompt and running "start_utility"

1. Close the utility after the game is closed by pressing CTRL+C in the command window.

NOTE: Recommend dual monitors so you can start/stop the uility in monitor A while running the game in monitor B.
